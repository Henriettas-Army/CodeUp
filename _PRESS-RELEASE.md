There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Sub-Heading ##
  > A networking application where people of similar software interests can learn, collaborate and connect.

## Summary ##
  > As a CodeUp user, you will have access to a community of programmers who are open to collaborations and connections. You will be able to find a variety of users based on your interests. A chat platform will allow you to chat with other users. If you are interested in what is currently going on around you, check out the map feature, or if you'd like to create or attend an event, check out the events page.

## Problem ##
  > When you are starting out programming, it is difficult to find real people to connect with. Often times online documentation is confusing and misleading, leaving one to wander aimlessly into the world of coding. For more experienced coders, there is not a platform to connect with other like-minded coders who want to meet up, code, and network. 

## Solution ##
  > A proximity-based social network for programmers

## Quote from You ##
  > "I trust in the vision of our company." -Guillermo

## How to Get Started ##
  > Simply sign in with GitHub and see what's going on around you. As a new user, provide your technical skills, interests, and location. Then, link up with users and events.

## Customer Quote ##
  > "Being a programmer can be very lonely, so when I heard about CodeUp, I was very excited to jump on the train." -James
